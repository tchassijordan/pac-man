# Pac-man

__Pac-man__ was a famous game of the 1980s, so on my road to becoming a better and more experience frontend developer I challenged myself to re-create this awesome game. Honestly it wasn't easy to do it, but the project was worth the effort. I used _Javascript_ as the core language together with _CSS_ and _HTML_ to get the game running.
